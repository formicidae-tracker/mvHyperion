*
*  Purpose: This is an example of some code that could run on an external
*  processor to control the booting of a Nios II processor.  Using a
*  PIO and the cpu_resetrequest signal, this routine holds the main Nios II
*  processor in reset while it copies an application from a boot record
*  in flash to RAM.  It then calls release_main_cpu(), which calculates the
*  entry point of the application, constructs a Nios II instruction which
*  branches to that entry point, then writes the instruction to the Nios II
*  reset address and releases the Nios II from reset.
*
*  This example code is of course predicated on the fact that the main Nios II
*  CPU's reset address is set to some volatile memory (RAM).  Otherwise, we
*  cant write an instruction to the reset address.
